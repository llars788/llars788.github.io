        <h2>First semester Senior at Bob Jones University in Greenville, South Carolina</h2>
        
         <p>I am a senior at Bob Jones University studying Biblical Counseling. I love helping people by showing them that the answers to life's problems are found in God's Word. While at school, I attend Community Baptist Church in Greer.</p>
         <p>
            I am from Kansas where my family lives on a farm. We grow corn and soybeans, we also raise cattle and chickens, and have several dogs. At home, I attend Carol Baptist Church, where I am involved in helping to teach Children's church, as well as the music ministry.            </p> 
         <p>
            I love playing games with my family or friends or reading! I have 3 younger siblings, and we all love spending time together.
